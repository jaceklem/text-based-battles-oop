# text-based-battles-oop
This repository is mainly made to practice OOP in python.
This small game will feature a small battle system, with some weapons. Nothing special in particular.

This game is my own fork of the project provided by "Ork Slayer Gamedev" on youtube. I want to thank him for his easy-to-follow tutorial on OOP.
